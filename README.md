# EFMapper
Modular tool for Projection and LED installation Mapping 

We are tired to have any license Issues by using commercial mapping software or would like to have more features and be more flexible.
So the EFMapper is born.

EFMapper will be build on base of openframeworks and will have some API or bindings for python. Also it have to be easaly extend with new features and understand common Protocolls such as DMX, OSC or Midi.

And the most important thing .. It will be OpenSource !! Now and Forever !!
